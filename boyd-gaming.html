            Boyd Gaming Corporation is an American gaming and hospitality company based in Paradise, Nevada. The company continues to be run by founder Sam Boyd's family under the management of Sam's granddaughter, Marianne Boyd-Johnson, who currently serves as the company's executive chairman after her father, Bill, was appointed Chairman Emeritus in May 2023.<br/><br/>As of 2021, Boyd operates 28 properties with a total of 10,751 hotel rooms and 1,694,482 square feet (157,422.5 m2) of casino space with 31,635 slot machines and 686 table games. Gaming revenue is 80% of total gross revenue.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Boyd Gaming's history dates to 1941, when founder Sam Boyd first arrived in Las Vegas with his family. After being hired as a dealer, Sam Boyd worked his way up through the ranks of the Las Vegas casino industry, first to pit boss, then shift boss. He eventually saved enough to buy a small interest in the Sahara Hotel and Casino; later, Sam Boyd left the Sahara to become general manager and partner of The Mint Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Sam Boyd first partnered with his son Bill in 1962, when the two teamed up to acquire the Eldorado Casino in Henderson, Nevada. Bill, who was then a practicing attorney, acquired his first stake in the Eldorado by doing its legal work. Sam would go on to manage the Eldorado full-time after the Mint was sold in 1968.
