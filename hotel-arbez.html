            The Hotel Arbez, also called the Hôtel Arbez Franco-Suisse or l’Arbézie, is a hotel that straddles the international border between France and Switzerland in the tiny village of La Cure, which is itself divided by the boundary.  Built by a private landowner and businessman specially to take advantage of an impending border adjustment between the two countries, the structure was originally used as a grocery store (its Swiss portion) and a pub (the French half).  Today, the entire building houses a hotel, whose dining room, kitchen and several rooms are bisected by the boundary.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>The unusual situation of the Hotel Arbez grew out of a dispute between France and Switzerland over possession of the Vallée des Dappes, just south and west of the tiny town of La Cure.  Though the valley had little value as a territorial possession, it provided an accessible military route between France and Savoy.  Annexed by Napoleonic France in 1802, it was returned to Switzerland by the Congress of Vienna, though the French continued to call for its retrocession.  After several attempts to acquire the area were firmly rebuffed by the Swiss, France decided in 1862 to offer a nearby section of its own territory, comparable in size, in exchange.  The Swiss agreed, and a treaty was accordingly signed in Bern by which slightly less than 8 square kilometres (3 sq mi) changed hands.  While La Cure had previously been located entirely inside France, the new boundary was slated to cut the village—including some residences and a pub—in half.  The treaty stipulated that any already-existing structure bisected by the border was to be left undisturbed, and this gave one local businessman an idea.
