            The Irish criminal David Byrne was shot dead on 5 February 2016 at the Regency Hotel in Whitehall, Dublin, Ireland.<br/><br/>It is believed by the Garda Síochána (police) that Daniel Kinahan, the son of Christy Kinahan, was the intended target, but had left early.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>Byrne had been investigated by every Garda specialist unit since he was a teenager.<br/><br/>He was present at the fatal stabbing of Declan Gavin in August 2001 in Crumlin, Dublin. He was called as a witness in the trial of Brian Rattigan for the killing, but said he had seen nothing.<br/><br/>David Byrne had been arrested many times and was a suspect in the murder of Gary Bryan in Walkinstown, Dublin, in 2006.<br/><br/>In January 2016, Gardaí had a special policing plan put in place for the following month when two boxing events would be attended by members of a criminal gang associated with Christy Kinahan. The Kinahan gang have a long association with boxing both in Dublin and Marbella in Spain.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Shooting ==<br/><br/>On 5 February 2016, there was to be a boxing match for the World Boxing Organization European lightweight title between Jamie Kavanagh and Antonio João Bento at the Regency Hotel in Whitehall, Dublin.
