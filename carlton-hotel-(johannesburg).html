            The Carlton Hotel is a historic hotel in the Central Business District of Johannesburg, South Africa. It opened in 1972 as part of the enormous Carlton Centre complex, and has been closed since 1998. Its closure has been attributed to the decay of the Central Business District, resulting in a severe crime wave and the flight of the city's corporate offices north to areas like Sandton and Rosebank. This created a plethora of vacant rooms that were unable to be filled. The main hotel tower was closed in December 1997.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== First Carlton Hotel ===<br/><br/>The first Carlton Hotel was located two blocks away, at the corner of Eloff Street &amp; Commissioner Street. Conceived in 1895 by mining magnate Barney Barnato as a huge, world-class luxury hotel with a theater, construction was finally begun by Barnato's heirs  in 1903, without the theater, after delays caused by Barnato's death and the Boer War. The Carlton was constructed by the Barnadot-Joel Mining Company and opened on February 20, 1906. The six-story hotel was the finest in southern Africa, with a telephone in every room and an early form of air conditioning. It hosted many celebrities, including King George VI, Queen Elizabeth, and the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret in 1947.
