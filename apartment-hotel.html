            An apartment hotel or aparthotel (also residential hotel or extended-stay hotel) is a serviced apartment complex that uses a hotel-style booking system. It is similar to renting an apartment, but with no fixed contracts and occupants can "check out" whenever they wish, subject to the applicable minimum length of stay imposed by the company.<br/><br/>An apartment hotel complex usually offers a complete fully fitted apartment. These complexes are usually custom built, and similar to a hotel complex containing a varied number of apartments. The length of stay in these apartment hotels is varied with anywhere from a few days to months or even years.  The people who stay in apartment hotels use them as long-term accommodation; therefore, the hotels are often fitted with most things the average home would require.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Apartment hotels were first created in holiday destinations as accommodation for families that needed to "live" in an apartment rather than "stay" as they would in a hotel. The apartments would provide a "holiday home" but generally be serviced. Later, these apartments evolved to be complete homes, allowing occupants to do everything they would at home, such as cleaning, washing, and cooking.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Extended stay hotels ==<br/><br/>Extended stay hotels, also called serviced apartments or aparthotels are a type of lodging with features unavailable at standard hotels.
