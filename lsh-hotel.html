            The LSH Hotel, formerly the Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, is a hotel in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The hotel was announced in 2014, as a joint project between Donald Trump's company, The Trump Organization, and LSH Barra, a Brazilian-based developer.<br/><br/>A portion of the hotel opened in August 2016, in time for the city's 2016 Summer Olympics. Later that year, a Brazilian prosecutor began investigating two small pension funds that contributed a total of $40 million to the project. The Trump Organization subsequently ended its management agreement with LHS Barra due to construction delays, and the hotel was renamed as the LHS Barra Hotel shortly thereafter.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 2014, Paulo Figueiredo Filho, the chief executive officer of Brazilian-based development company LSH Barra, signed a licensing and management deal with Donald Trump's company, The Trump Organization, for a beachfront hotel project in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to be named Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro. Figueiredo, a grandson of former Brazilian president João Figueiredo, would own the hotel, while The Trump Organization would operate it. Figueiredo said that by boasting of his connection to Brazil's former president, he got Trump interested in having his company manage the hotel property. The Trump Organization did not financially invest in the project.<br/><br/>The hotel was announced in January 2014.
