            A hotel manager, hotelier, or lodging manager is a person who manages the operation of a hotel, motel, resort, or other lodging-related establishment. Management of a hotel operation includes, but is not limited to management of hotel staff, business management, upkeep and sanitary standards of hotel facilities, guest satisfaction and customer service, marketing management, sales management, revenue management, financial accounting, purchasing, and other functions. The title "hotel manager" or "hotelier" often refers to the hotel's general manager who serves as a hotel's head executive, though their duties and responsibilities vary depending on the hotel's size, purpose, and expectations from ownership. The hotel's general manager is often supported by subordinate department managers that are responsible for individual departments and key functions of the hotel operations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Hotel management structure ==<br/><br/>The size and complexity of a hotel management organizational structure varies significantly depending on the size, features, and function of the hotel or resort. A small hotel operation normally may consist of a small core management team consisting of a hotel manager and a few key department supervisors who directly handle day-to-day operations. On the other hand, a large full-service hotel or resort complex often operates more similarly to a large corporation with an executive board headed by the general manager and consisting of key directors serving as heads of individual hotel departments. Each department at the large hotel or resort complex may normally consist of subordinate line-level managers and supervisors who handle day-to-day operations.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Example of large/full service hotel or resort complex ===<br/><br/>A typical organizational chart for a large resort hotel operation may often resemble the following:<br/><br/>General manager reports to a regional vice president and/or ownership/investors<br/><br/><br/><br/>General manager or managing director<br/><br/>Assistant general manager or resident manager<br/><br/>Director of operations or rooms division<br/><br/>Director of front office or front office manager<br/><br/>Front desk manager (shift manager)<br/><br/>Bell captain<br/><br/>Chief concierge<br/><br/>Valet captain or parking manager<br/><br/>PBX/communications manager<br/><br/>Overnight manager or head night auditor<br/><br/>Director of housekeeping or executive housekeeper<br/><br/>Assistant director of housekeeping or executive housekeeper<br/><br/>Floor manager (shift manager)<br/><br/>Laundry manager<br/><br/>Director of revenue management or revenue manager<br/><br/>Reservations manager<br/><br/>Director of sales &amp; marketing<br/><br/>Senior sales manager<br/><br/>Leisure sales manager<br/><br/>Business travel sales manager<br/><br/>Social group sales manager<br/><br/>Corporate group sales manager<br/><br/>Marketing manager<br/><br/>Social media manager<br/><br/>Public relations manager<br/><br/>Director of food &amp; beverage<br/><br/>Restaurant manager<br/><br/>Assistant restaurant manager<br/><br/>Executive chef<br/><br/>Room service manager<br/><br/>Butlers manager<br/><br/>Club manager<br/><br/>Bar &amp; lounge manager<br/><br/>Banquets manager<br/><br/>Director of group and events<br/><br/>Assistant director of events<br/><br/>Convention services manager<br/><br/>Event manager<br/><br/>Catering manager<br/><br/>Director of finance<br/><br/>Accounting manager<br/><br/>Payroll manager<br/><br/>Purchasing manager<br/><br/>Director of engineering<br/><br/>Chief engineer<br/><br/>Maintenance manager<br/><br/>Facilities manager<br/><br/>Director of human resources<br/><br/>Human Resources manager<br/><br/>Recruiting manager<br/><br/>Training manager<br/><br/>Labor relations manager (for unionized hotels)<br/><br/>Chief of security<br/><br/>Recreation manager<br/><br/>Information technology manager<br/><br/>Additional management positions may exist for additional facilities such as hotel-owned golf courses, casinos, or spas.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Example for small/limited service hotel ===<br/><br/>A typical organizational chart for a small low-rise hotel operation may resemble the following:<br/><br/>Hotel manager reports to regional director and/or ownership/investors<br/><br/><br/><br/>General manager<br/><br/>Guest service manager (front of house)<br/><br/>Housekeeping manager<br/><br/>Chief engineer<br/><br/>Sales &amp; marketing manager<br/><br/>Food &amp; beverage manager<br/><br/>Account manager<br/><br/>Administrative functions for a small-scale hotel such as accounting, payroll, and human resources may normally be handled by a centralized corporate office or solely by the hotel manager.
