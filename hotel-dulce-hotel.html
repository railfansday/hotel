            Hotel, dulce hotel (Hotel, Sweet Hotel) is the fifth studio album of the Spanish singer-songwriter Joaquín Sabina, released in 1987 one year after Joaquín Sabina y Viceversa en directo, his previous live album. This was his third release under Ariola.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Background ==<br/><br/>After the successful tour and live album released one year before, in this fifth studio album, Sabina counted for the first time with the executive production of Pancho Varona, who had previously collaborated with him two years before in Juez y parte as a support musician. This personal and creative friendship also led to the creation of a society called Ripio S.A. in which many of their future productions would be registered. The album was recorded in the Eurosonic Studios of Madrid.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Style and production ==<br/><br/>On this album, Sabina started exploring other type of emotions such as love or affection, a type of songs that was not present in his repertoire before. The result was a more intimate and sentimental work than the previous ones.<br/><br/>The first maxi single of this album was "Así estoy yo sin ti" (That's how I am without you), a song about the end of a relationship and the feelings of loneliness that this creates. Unexpectedly, this song turned into a great hit, to the point that a promotional video was recorded for it with the participation of some popular actresses such as Emma Suarez and Kiti Manver.<br/><br/>The second single was the hard rock hit entitled "Pacto entre caballeros" (Deal between gentlemen), which tells a weird, but true story in which Sabina is assaulted by three burglars, who after recognising his face, invite him to drink some beers in a bar.
