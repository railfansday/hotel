            Hotel Figueroa (also the Figueroa Hotel, colloquially The Fig) is a hotel building in the South Park district of Downtown Los Angeles. Originally opened as a hostelry exclusive to women, the hotel underwent a transformation into a Moroccan-themed space in the 1970s before being restored to its initial Spanish Colonial architecture in 2014.<br/><br/>Founded in 1926 by the YWCA, the hotel was established to provide a haven for professional women, allowing them to lodge without the requirement of a male escort. It became a gathering place for business women and club women, initially catering exclusively to women with men having limited access to the building. Two years later, they expanded their clientele to include men to boost business. Following a period of decline in the 1950s and 1960s, Swedish entrepreneur Uno Thimansson purchased the hotel, converting it into a Moroccan-themed space that was known for its affordability compared to other hotels. The hotel remained this way until 2014 when a joint venture between GreenOak Real Estate and Urban Lifestyle Hotels acquired the property. They started a restoration process in order to return it to its original Spanish Colonial architecture, which was completed in 2018.<br/><br/>The hotel is 13 stories high and includes a coffin-shaped pool, the only remaining hotel pool on the ground floor, both due to limits from the city's architecture regulations at the time of its construction. The sides of the building have been used for hand-painted advertisements since the 1980s.
