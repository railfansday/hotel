            Hotel Chevalier is a 2007 short film written and directed by Wes Anderson. Starring Jason Schwartzman and Natalie Portman as former lovers who reunite in a Paris hotel room, the 13-minute film acts as a prologue to Anderson's 2007 feature The Darjeeling Limited. It was shot on location in a Parisian hotel by a small crew and self-financed by Anderson, who initially intended it to be a stand-alone work. Its first showing was at the Venice Film Festival premiere of the feature film on September 2, 2007, and it made its own debut later that month at Apple Stores in four U.S. cities.<br/><br/>The day after the film's premiere, it was made freely available from the iTunes Store for one month, during which time it was downloaded more than 500,000 times. The film garnered acclaim from reviewers, who compared it favorably to The Darjeeling Limited and praised its richness, poignancy, and careful construction.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Plot ==<br/><br/>In a hotel lobby, the concierge answers a phone call from a guest's room. Jack (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film Stalag 17 and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from the concierge in broken French, he receives a call from Rhett, his ex-girlfriend. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number.
