            Gilpatrick Hotel was situated at 223 Third Street in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the United States. It was opened in 1907 and was operated by members of the Gilpatrick family. The hotel was the site of the attempted assassination of Theodore Roosevelt in 1912.<br/><br/>In 1941 the hotel was razed and in 1979 the Hyatt Regency Milwaukee was erected in its place. In 1926 a memorial plaque commemorating the assassination attempt was affixed to the front of the Gilpatrick; it was removed, stored, and subsequently attached to the new hotel.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>The building was constructed in the style of Romanesque Revival architecture. It was originally occupied by the Romadka Bros Company, manufacturers of luggage trunks. They used the building to house their offices and they were a well-known company in Milwaukee.<br/><br/>Martin G. Gilpatrick started the Milwaukee hotel in 1907. The building had to be remodeled in order to create hotel rooms.
