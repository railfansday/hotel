            The Ritz Paris is a hotel in central Paris, overlooking the Place Vendôme in the city's 1st arrondissement. A member of The Leading Hotels of the World marketing group, the Ritz Paris is ranked among the most luxurious hotels in the world.<br/><br/>The hotel was founded in 1898 by the Swiss hotelier César Ritz in collaboration with the French chef Auguste Escoffier. The hotel was constructed behind the façade of an eighteenth-century townhouse. It was among the first hotels in Europe to provide an en suite bathroom, electricity, and a telephone for each room. It quickly established a reputation for luxury and attracted a clientele that included royalty, politicians, writers, film stars, and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel including Coco Chanel, and the cocktail lounge Bar Hemingway pays tribute to writer Ernest Hemingway.<br/><br/>The hotel was renovated from 1980 to 1987 following its purchase by Mohamed Al-Fayed; and again from 2012 to 2016. While the hotel has not applied for the 'Palace' distinction from the French ministry of economy, industry and employment, its Suite Impériale has been listed by the French government as a national monument.<br/><br/>Because of its status as a symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel is featured in many notable works of fiction, including novels (F. Scott Fitzgerald's Tender Is the Night and Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises), a play (Noël Coward's play Semi-Monde), and films (Billy Wilder's 1957 comedy Love in the Afternoon and William Wyler's 1966 comedy How to Steal a Million).
