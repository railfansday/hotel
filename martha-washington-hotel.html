            The Martha Washington Hotel (later known as Hotel Thirty Thirty, Hotel Lola, King &amp; Grove New York, and The Redbury New York) was a hotel at 30 East 30th Street (later 29 East 29th Street) in the NoMad neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. Opened in 1903 and operated as a women-only hotel for 95 years, the 13-story structure was designed by Robert W. Gibson in the Renaissance Revival style for the Women's Hotel Company. The hotel's namesake, Martha Washington, was the first First Lady of the United States. It is a New York City designated landmark.<br/><br/>The facade is largely made of brick and stone and contains classical design elements such as brackets, dentils, ornate lintels, quoins, and rustication. On both 29th and 30th Streets, the facade is divided vertically into seven bays and horizontally into a two-story base and ten-story upper section, with a recessed top floor. The hotel originally contained several amenity areas for guests on the lower two stories, including a lobby, dining rooms, reception rooms, and ballroom. Generally men were only permitted to enter the ground-level spaces and some of the second-story spaces. The upper stories originally contained 200 short-term guest rooms and 400 long-term residences, which were downsized to 250 hotel rooms by the 2020s.<br/><br/>The Woman's Hotel Company was established in 1897 and sought to identify a site and raise money over the following four years.
