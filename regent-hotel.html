            Regent Hotels &amp; Resorts is a British-American luxury hospitality brand, founded by hotelier Robert H. Burns in 1970. After passing through different owners since foundation, it is currently jointly owned by IHG Hotels &amp; Resorts and Formosa International Hotels Corporation since July 2018, with hotels and resorts in Asia, Europe and North America.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The brand was founded by hotelier Robert H. Burns as a joint venture with Japan's Tokyu Group in 1970, opening its first property in Waikiki Beach, Honolulu in 1971. Burns was, soon after, joined by Georg Rafael and Adrian Zecha, who together developed and expanded Regent's footprint to 17 hotels worldwide. In 1981, The Regent Hong Kong opened to great acclaim and was consistently labelled "the world's best hotel". The Regent Beverly Wilshire joined the chain in 1985, and later served as the setting for the 1990 film Pretty Woman, which helped cement Regent's reputation as a luxury hotel operator at the time.<br/><br/>In 1986, EIE International acquired a 35% stake. When Burns decided to sell his remaining 65% stake in 1992, EIE exercised its right of first refusal to acquire the entire company, which was then promptly sold to the Four Seasons hotel chain. Regent properties that were under development at the time of purchase in Bali, Milan, New York, and Istanbul were subsequently opened under the Four Seasons flag. Furthermore, Regent Hotels in Jakarta, Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Sydney, as well as the Beverly Wilshire were likewise absorbed into the Four Seasons chain.
