            The Shelbourne Hotel is a historic hotel in Dublin, Ireland, situated in a landmark building on the north side of St Stephen's Green.  Currently owned by Archer Hotel Capital and operated by Marriott International, the hotel has 265 rooms in total and reopened in March 2007 after undergoing an eighteen-month refurbishment.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Shelbourne Hotel was founded in 1824 by Martin Burke, a native of County Tipperary, when he acquired three adjoining townhouses overlooking Stephen's Green, Europe's largest garden square. Burke named his grand new hotel The Shelbourne, after William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne. William Makepeace Thackeray was an early guest, staying in 1842 and including a piece about the Shelbourne in The Irish Sketch-Book (1843). <br/><br/>In July 1877, Dom Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil, stayed at the hotel as part of a largely unpublicised visit to Ireland.<br/><br/>In the early 1900s, Alois Hitler, Jr., the elder half-brother of Adolf Hitler, worked in the hotel while in Dublin.<br/><br/>In the late 19th century, the ability for a wealthy gentleman to be able to "handle the ribbons" of his own coach was popular for a time, according to a 1947 article in the Dublin Historical Record. Sir Thomas Talbot Power (1863–1930), one of the Power baronets, was a "devotee of this sport" and would drive "a coach-and-four from the Shelbourne Hotel, for public hire, to Bray and back". For a fee, one or more passengers would be driven  to Bray, have dinner at the International Hotel ("at which Sir Thomas usually provided champagne"), and would be driven back to the Shelbourne afterwards.
