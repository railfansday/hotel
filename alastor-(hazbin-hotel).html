            Alastor "the Radio Demon" is a fictional character created by Vivienne "VivziePop" Medrano who primarily appears in the musical adult animated series Hazbin Hotel as one of the overlords of Hell. He was voiced by Edward Bosco and Gabriel C. Brown in the pilot and a series of music videos from 2019 to 2024, and by Amir Talai in the animated series since 2024. A constantly-smiling sinner, Alastor returns after a seven-year absence to run a hotel known as the Hazbin Hotel (meant to redeem the souls of those in Hell and help them earn a place in Heaven) with Charlie Morningstar, princess of Hell, whom Alastor seeks to guide and control, while also wanting to free his own soul from the service of an unknown being. He is often accompanied by the hotel's bartender Husk and housekeeper Niffty (whose souls he owns), and he is considered a rival by fellow overlord Vox and Charlie's father, Lucifer.<br/><br/>The character has received a positive critical reception, receiving particular attention as a prominent asexual character in media.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Conception and creation ==<br/><br/>Alastor was created by Medrano during her time at School of Visual Arts in New York City, appearing unnamed on her DeviantArt page "circa. 2008". He was planned to be incorporated into her 2012 webcomic series ZooPhobia as a supporting character in a planned "Angels and Demons" story arc following his formal creation in 2011; on the arc's cancellation in 2016 and subsequent redevelopment as Hazbin Hotel, Alastor's full ZooPhobia design would not see publication.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Design and voice ===<br/><br/>In the unpublished ZooPhobia story arc Angels and Demons, Alastor was depicted as a black-and-red demonic deer able to transform into a humanoid deer. He was described as "enjoy[ing] making deals and tricking mortals into service".
