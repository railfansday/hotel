            The Breakers Palm Beach is a historic, Renaissance Revival style luxury hotel with 534 rooms. It is located at 1 South County Road in Palm Beach, Florida. During the 1895–96 winter season, business tycoon Henry Flagler opened the first Breakers resort, then the only oceanfront lodging south of Daytona Beach, to accommodate additional tourists due to the popularity of his Royal Poinciana Hotel. Known as the Palm Beach Inn upon its original opening, it was renamed The Breakers in 1901 after guests requested rooms "over by the breakers". While the Royal Poinciana Hotel permanently closed in the 1930s due to the Great Depression, The Breakers became a primary resort in Palm Beach, hosting many famous guests throughout the years. The current structure is the third incarnation of the hotel, having opened in December 1926 following two earlier structures on the same site that burned down in 1903 and 1925.<br/><br/>Since 1973, The Breakers has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, the hotel and grounds occupy 140 acres (57 ha) and employ over 2,300 people. The Breakers has also received high acclaim from organizations and media agencies such as the American Automobile Association, American Institute of Architects, Forbes Travel Guide, and the U.S. News &amp; World Report.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Early history ==<br/><br/>After experiencing success in the first few years of operation of the nearby Royal Poinciana Hotel, business tycoon Henry Flagler sought to accommodate more travelers on his Florida East Coast Railway and began construction on a second hotel in Palm Beach in 1895.
