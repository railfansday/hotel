            The Mutiny Hotel or The Mutiny Hotel on the Bay in Coconut Grove is a luxury hotel and resort located at Biscayne Bay on the Eastern Seaboard southwest of the Downtown Miami Historic District and Miami Beach Architectural District.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>Sailboat Bay was built by Burton Goldberg in the Coconut Grove Historic District in 1968 as a 105-suite apartment building costing $3.5 million. In constructing the complex, described as Coconut Grove's first high-rise, 100 coral boulders were shipped from west Dade County. The apartments were converted to hotel units in 1976. The Mutiny name was first associated with a private club on the property opened in 1971. During the 1970s and 1980s the clientele included athletes, Hollywood celebrities, and musicians, including Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, and Crosby &amp; Nash, whose song "Mutiny" on their Whistling Down the Wire album is a tribute to this hotel; it drew comparisons to Studio 54. Hotel rooms were themed, including the Bordello Room, Gypsy Caravan, and Hot Fudge.<br/><br/>In 1983, a consortium of investors was loaned $13.5 million by the Sunrise Savings and Loan to buy the hotel, in part based on an appraisal that the hotel was worth $5 million more than it actually was. The borrowers defaulted, Sunrise sank into receivership over a series of bad loans in 1985, and efforts began to sell the property. However, that ownership coincided with a dramatic decline in quality.
