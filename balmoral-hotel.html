            The Balmoral Hotel is a hotel and landmark in Edinburgh, Scotland. It is located in the heart of the city at the east end of Princes Street, the main shopping street beneath the Edinburgh Castle rock, and the southern edge of the New Town.<br/><br/>It is accessed from Princes Street, on its north side, and flanked by North Bridge and Waverley Steps. The latter gives pedestrian access to Waverley Station to the south, to which it was formerly linked. The hotel has been a Category B listed building since 1994.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/><br/><br/>Resulting from a competition in 1895, the hotel was designed by William Hamilton Beattie for the North British Railway Company as a railway hotel adjacent to their newly rebuilt Waverley station. It was completed after Beattie's death by his assistant Andrew Robb Scott and opened as the North British Railway Hotel on 15 October 1902. The site, 52 North Bridge, was previously the location of pharmacists Duncan, Flockhart and company; William Flockhart supplied Dr. (later Sir) James Young Simpson with the first chloroform anaesthetic, which he tried on himself at his home 52 Queen Street in 1847, and became standard practice in childbirth. The International Association for the Study of Pain placed a commemorative plaque at the hotel in 1981.
