            The New York Marriott World Trade Center, also known as 3 World Trade Center (3 WTC), was a 22-story, 825-room hotel in New York City, within the original World Trade Center complex in downtown Manhattan. It opened in April 1981 as the Vista International Hotel, the first major hotel since 1836 to open in Manhattan south of Canal Street.<br/><br/>The hotel was damaged in the World Trade Center bombing by al-Qaeda terrorists on February 26, 1993. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey considered demolishing the building, but instead decided to repair it. The building's structure was reinforced, and it re-opened in November 1994. In November 1995, it was bought by Marriott Corporation and renamed the New York Marriott World Trade Center. <br/><br/>In 2001, as part of the September 11 attacks by al-Qaeda, the hotel was mostly destroyed by the collapse of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers (1 and 2 WTC), after two planes were crashed into them. 43 people inside the hotel died: 41 firefighters and two guests. Only the southern end of the building was spared, and it was eventually demolished to make way for reconstruction. The hotel was not replaced as part of the post-2001 World Trade Center complex, although its address (3 WTC) was reused for the tower at 175 Greenwich Street.
