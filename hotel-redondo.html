            Hotel Redondo was a hotel in Redondo Beach, California, that opened in 1890 and was demolished in 1925.  The hotel, which had 225 rooms in three stories, was built in a High Victorian style.  Construction cost approximately $500,000.  At the time, it was one of the most important hotels in Southern California.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Land acquisition ==<br/><br/>When Don Miguel Dominguez died in 1882, he owned a massive parcel of land, Rancho San Pedro, which was passed on to his six daughters. A portion of that land, known as the "Ocean Tract", went to three of his daughters, Susana, Guadalupe and Maria de Los Reyes Dominguez. In 1889, this 433 acre Ocean Tract was sold for $12,000 to two Oregon steamship operators and entrepreneurs, Robert Thompson and Captain John Ainsworth. Looking to expand their growing company, "The Oregon Navigation Company", Thompson and Ainsworth formed the Redondo Beach Company and promoted and developed the area as a tourist destination, as well as, a port for their fleet.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Origins ==<br/><br/>As America approached the 20th Century, the town of Redondo Beach had just been incorporated and was determined to become a worldly destination. Located on the southern shores of the Santa Monica Bay, it had a large submarine canyon that allowed wooden cargo ships, with their deep hulls, to get close enough to the coast to offload their goods onto train cars waiting on one of the several wharfs along the beach.
