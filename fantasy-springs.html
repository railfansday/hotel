            Fantasy Springs is a themed area at Tokyo DisneySea. Described as the park's eighth "port of call", the area takes the theme of 'a magical spring that leads to a world of Disney fantasy' and comprises three distinct areas recreating the worlds of the Disney films Peter Pan, Frozen and Tangled. Fantasy Springs includes four attractions, three restaurants, one shop, and a new luxury hotel situated inside the park. Built at an estimated construction cost of ¥320 billion and a development area of approximately 140,000 square meters, Fantasy Springs is the largest expansion of Tokyo Disney Resort since the initial opening of Tokyo DisneySea in 2001.<br/><br/>Fantasy Springs held its grand opening on 6 June 2024.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== History ==<br/><br/>In 2015, Tokyo DisneySea announced the addition of a new "Scandinavia" port based on the 3D computer-animated musical film Frozen. However, this is shelved in favor of Tokyo Disneyland's Fantasyland expansion and the Frozen plans would be repurposed for a larger expansion project.<br/><br/><br/><br/>On 14 June 2018, Tokyo Disney Resort announced the new port will include three sections themed to Peter Pan, Frozen and Tangled as well as a new hotel.<br/><br/>On 27 October 2022, The Oriental Land Company announced that "due to the extension of the project’s construction period, which was impacted by delay in productions overseas, as well as restrictions placed on logistics and border measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19" the opening date of Fantasy Springs had been pushed back to Spring 2024, later announced as 6 June 2024. It was also announced that each area would be called Frozen Kingdom, Rapunzel's Forest and Peter Pan's Never Land respectively.
