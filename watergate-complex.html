            The Watergate complex is a group of six buildings in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C., United States. The complex includes a development of cooperative apartment residences. It also includes a hotel and an office building, which was the location of the Watergate burglary on June 17, 1972, which led to the resignation of U.S. president Richard Nixon two years later, on August 8, 1974 and serves as the basis for the complex's infamy. The complex covers a total of 10 acres (4 ha) just north of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Buildings ==<br/><br/>Watergate complex buildings include:<br/><br/><br/><br/>Watergate West at 2700 Virginia Avenue NW, a cooperative apartment<br/><br/>Watergate 600 (600 New Hampshire Avenue NW), an office building<br/><br/>Watergate Hotel at 2650 Virginia Avenue NW<br/><br/>Watergate East at 2500 Virginia Avenue NW, cooperative apartments<br/><br/>Watergate North at 2510 Virginia Avenue NW, cooperative apartments with two lobbies (one is North and one is South)<br/><br/>Watergate South at 700 New Hampshire Avenue NW, cooperative apartments<br/><br/>Watergate Office Building at 2600 Virginia Ave NW, the office building where the Watergate burglary occurred on June 17, 1972<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== History ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>For over a century, the land now occupied by the Watergate complex belonged to the Gas Works of the Washington Gas Light Company, which produced "manufactured gas", a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other flammable and nonflammable gases, for heating, cooking, and lighting throughout Washington, D.C. Gas production ceased at the site in 1947, and the plant was demolished shortly thereafter.<br/><br/>During the 1950s, the World Bank considered building its international headquarters here and on the adjacent site (which now houses the Kennedy Center), but rejected the site for unspecified reasons. It constructed its headquarters at its current location at 1818 H Street NW in Washington, D.C.<br/><br/>Built between 1963 and 1971, the Watergate became one of the most desirable living spaces in Washington, D.C., popular with members of Congress and political appointees of the executive branch. The complex has been sold several times since the 1980s. During the 1990s, it was subdivided and its component buildings and parts of buildings were sold to various owners.<br/><br/>In 1972, the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, then located on the sixth floor of the Watergate Office Building, was burgled; private campaign documents were photographed and telephones were wiretapped.
