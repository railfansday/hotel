            Hazbin Hotel and Helluva Boss are two American animated series created, directed, written, and produced by Vivienne "VivziePop" Medrano, animated primarily by SpindleHorse Toons, and set in Hell. Some of the characters of the shows were originally developed for Medrano's cancelled webcomic series ZooPhobia.<br/><br/>Hazbin Hotel focuses on eight characters: Charlie Morningstar, princess of Hell and owner of the Hazbin Hotel, which offers sinners a chance at redemption to enter Heaven; Vaggie, her girlfriend; hotel patrons Angel Dust and Sir Pentious; Alastor, the powerful "Radio Demon" and Charlie's business partner; Husk, the hotel's bartender; Niffty, the hotel's maid; and Adam, the first man and leader of Heaven's exterminator angels ("Exorcists"), who leads an annual Extermination of Hell's sinners.<br/><br/>Helluva Boss initially focuses on five characters: Blitzo, an imp and head of the assassination company I.M.P; Moxxie and Millie, a married imp couple employed at I.M.P; Loona, Blitzo's adopted hellhound daughter; and Stolas, a Goetian prince of Hell, whom Blitzo has an intimate relationship with. The second season further focuses on Fizzarolli, a jester celebrity and Blitzo's childhood friend, and Crimson, a mob boss and Moxxie's father.<br/><br/>Both series also feature numerous supporting characters, each of whom plays a prominent role in a story arc. Included among them are the angels of Heaven, many other sinners and Hellborn demons, the Seven Deadly Sins, and the overlords of Hell.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Principal characters of Hazbin Hotel ==<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>=== Charlie Morningstar ===<br/><br/><br/><br/>Charlie Morningstar (voiced by Erika Henningsen) is the main protagonist and founder of the Hazbin Hotel. She is the daughter of King Lucifer and Queen Lilith, and was born in Hell. Charlie is optimistic and cares deeply for the well-being of her people, which is not taken seriously by the majority of demons in Hell.
