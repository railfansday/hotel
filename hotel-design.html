            Hotel design involves the planning, drafting, design and development of hotels. The concept of hotel design is rooted in traditions of hospitality to travellers dating back to ancient times, and the development of many diverse types of hotels has occurred in many cultures. For example, the advent of rail travel in the early 1900s led to the planning, design and development of hotels near railroad stations that catered to rail travelers. Hotels around Grand Central Terminal in New York City are an example of this phenomenon. Hotel interior design and styles are very diverse, with numerous variations existent.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Types of hotels ==<br/><br/>Numerous types of hotel designs exist in the world. Examples of hotel designs include guest palaces across Asia, English country inns, hotel-casino resorts, designer and art hotels, hotel-spa resorts, boutique hotels, "no-frills" hotels that offer very basic amenities at budget rates, basic rooming houses, monasteries offering refuge and spare bedrooms rented out in ordinary homes. Another type is capsule hotels, which are offered in Japan as an option for those who just need the basic necessities during their stay.  Historically, the development of lodging areas and facilities was sometimes driven by their physical locations, such as at river crossings, at major trading posts or in locations lending themselves to defense, such as forts or castles. Property location continues to be a key consideration in hotel design in contemporary times.
