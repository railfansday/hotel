            The Hotel Inspector is an observational documentary television series which is broadcast on the British terrestrial television station, Channel 5, and other networks around the world.<br/><br/>In each episode, celebrated hotelier and businesswoman Alex Polizzi visits a struggling British hotel to try to turn its fortunes around by giving advice and suggestions to the owner. The current host, Alex Polizzi (since 2008), has featured in nineteen series of The Hotel Inspector, including four series of The Hotel Inspector: Returns and one series of Hotel Inspector: Checking In, Checking Out. Her predecessor, Ruth Watson, presented four series between 2005 and 2008, including the first and only series of The Hotel Inspector: Revisited.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>== Summary ==<br/><br/>The series began in late September 2005 and was an instant ratings hit; the show attracted 2.5 million viewers at its peak and this prompted Channel 5 to commission another series. The second series was broadcast in July 2006, followed by a third series in September 2007. The show won a Royal Television Society Award in November 2006.<br/><br/>Accompanied with the third series, an additional complementary series, The Hotel Inspector: Unseen ran on Fiver (now 5*), one of Channel 5's digital channels, immediately after the main show. It showed unseen footage, including video diaries shot by the hoteliers, revealing their reactions to the inspector's opinions.<br/><br/>After three series of The Hotel Inspector, Ruth Watson left a message on her website stating that she would not be filming another series, despite it being one of the channel's most watched shows.
